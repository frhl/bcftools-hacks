## BCFtools plugin hacks
This repository contains 'hacked' plugins so that we can write out meta information while the functions are running. For example, trio-switch-error, we write out the trios who are and positions that contains switches.

## original title
BCFtools implements utilities for variant calling (in conjunction with
SAMtools) and manipulating VCF and BCF files.  The program is intended
to replace the Perl-based tools from vcftools.

See INSTALL for building and installation instructions.
